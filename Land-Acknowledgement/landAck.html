    <h1>Land Acknowledgment</h1>
    <p>I want to acknowledge that we reside on treaty 6 territory, which is the ancestral territory of the Cree, Dene,
      Blackfoot, Saulteaux, Nakota Sioux, and also the homeland of the Métis. We acknowledge the atrocities of the past
      and will put great efforts towards reconsiliation.</p>
